        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The opioid crisis is a very critical public health issue in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of lives lost to drug overdoses each year. This project focuses on accidental drug-related deaths specifically in Connecticut from 2012 to 2023. By analyzing and visualizing this dataset, we will uncover trends, geographical patterns, and demographic factors associated with overdose fatalities. This project is important because it can help policymakers, health organizations, and the public better understand the crisis and its effects and identify areas where intervention and change are needed.</p>

        <h2>Data Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our data comes from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Connecticut and was found on the data.gov website. The data consists of a listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2023. The data currently has 11,973 rows, but we expect that to go down after we clean it. There are also currently 48 columns relating to the victim’s demographics, the location of the death, the cause of death, and the drugs in the victim’s system.</p>
