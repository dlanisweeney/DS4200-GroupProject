        <h2>Analysis of Age Distribution by Sex</h2>
        <p>
            This graph illustrates the age distribution of individuals in our dataset that have overdosed in the state of Connecticut, segmented by their sex. The 'Age' feature is represented on the x-axis, and the number of occurrences for each age group is on the y-axis. Males are shown in blue, females in pink, and any unknown or unclassified entries (marked as "Unknown" or "X") are represented in gray.
